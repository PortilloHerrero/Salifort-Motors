# Salifort-Motors (Employee Retention project)
Salifort Motors is a fictional Spanish-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.
Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate,
and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s
end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection
of alternative energy and automobiles.
Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention and answer the following
question:
**What’s likely to make the employee leave the company?**
In order to answer the question, as the variable they are seeking to predict is
categorical, we have built a logistic regression and a random forest model.
We have compared their accuracy, provided insights and recommendations based
on the data.
This model helps predict whether an employee will leave and identify which factors
are most influential. These insights can help HR make decisions to improve
employee retention.
