# Salifort-Motors
Data science project where i work on trying to predict employee retention from an automotive company.
Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention and answer the following
question:
Whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?
In order to answer the question, as the variable they are seeking to predict is
categorical, we have built a logistic regression and a random forest model.
We have compared their accuracy, provided insights and recommendations based
on the data.
This model helps predict whether an employee will leave and identify which factors
are most influential. These insights can help HR make decisions to improve
employee retention.

With the descriptive statistics from the data set we can see first data insights. At first we can see
some data points that attract our attention as average monthly hours with very high values.
We can also see from the first two steps that some columns have some typos and do not follow a
standarize style. It is really important to standarize the writing of the columns as it allows a better
readibility and consistency.
We will correct the typos and standarize the names:
